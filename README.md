# Eat The Sages
An attempt to create my own personal mythology that:

1. passes my own bullshit test 

2. connects me deeply to myself, my interests, and the world, and 

3. affords ways to see the world clearly, make sense of it, participate in it, and talk about it.

After brainstorming a bunch of different ways to structure it, I’ve settled on 12 sages that must be internalized. Each represents a wicked problem that can’t be solved through ideology/principles but must be integrated as a nebulous optimization between opposing forces.

Internalizing a sage requires several stages. First we must meet them as a Fool, then idolize them as a Hero, then despise them as a Monster, and finally “eat” them as a Sage and in part become them.

It’s already a fantastically weird mythology, as may be apparent. I’m as interested in the process of designing a mythology as I am in seeing what the end result is. I will share the steps so others can build their own if they want to, and have assistance during the tricky parts.

This silly experiment will start with an exploration of the first Sage in its four forms. First we meet the Foolish Duck, who knows nothing but is curious about everything. Next we’ll idolize the Heroic Duck, despise the Monster Duck, and finally learn how to eat the Sage Duck.

All 12 sages are: 

1. The Duck
2. The Frog
3. The Goat
4. The Snail
5. The Albatross
6. The Turtle
7. The Platypus
8. The Beetle
9. The Hawk
10. The Snake
11. The Fox
12. The Grasshopper
